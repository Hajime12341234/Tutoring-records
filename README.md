# Tutoring Notes Repository

Welcome to my personal collection of PDF notes and slides created for tutoring first-year students at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC). These materials were designed to help students strengthen their mathematical foundations, enjoy a creative aspect of pure mathematics, and prepare for competitive program admissions at the end of first year. 

Each document in this repository was carefully written to provide clear explanations, intuitive motivation, and rigorous proofs for core mathematical concepts.

## Document Descriptions

### Set theory and the basis of the vector space.pdf
A self-made slide deck introducing the concept that every vector space has a basis. It begins with foundational topics from set theory and linear algebra, including Zorn’s Lemma and the Axiom of Choice. The core proof is accompanied by motivations—such as the existence of a Hamel basis for ℝ over ℚ—and an application problem to help the student contextualize the result.

### tutoring_notes_on_ultrafilter.pdf
One of my favorite documents, this guide introduces students to ultrafilters—an advanced and elegant topic in set theory and topology. It covers two cool results: the Ultrafilter Theorem and a result related to the finite intersection property. Though challenging, we could cover up to the end of the first cool theorem in tutoring, and Zorn’s Lemma was used in the proofs to illustrate its power.

### Proof_Infinite_Prime.pdf
This document presents a lesser-known proof of the infinitude of prime numbers using topological arguments. It includes a brief introduction to topology at the beginning to make the material accessible. The goal was to show my student a beautiful and unexpected way in which different branches of mathematics convey the same idea. My student enjoyed this version of proof for infinite primes.

### Graph Theory.pdf
A comprehensive 70+ page slide deck designed to prepare my student for CSCA67 (Discrete Mathematics) at UTSC. Despite its length, we covered the core material in just two tutoring sessions. The notes clearly explain fundamental concepts, definitions, and theorems in graph theory.

### Tutoring_notes_for_elementary_real_analysis.pdf
This document introduces students to the basics of real analysis and abstract mathematical thinking. It includes foundational theorems and proofs—such as the density of ℚ in ℝ and properties of sequences—that build intuition and help prepare for university-level calculus courses.

### A_Hausdorff_Noetherian_Space_Is_Finite.pdf
A note exploring an interesting topological result: that a Hausdorff Noetherian space must be finite. Although I haven’t yet used this document in tutoring sessions, it was intended to introduce my student to higher-level topology once they’ve mastered the fundamentals.

## Purpose

These notes are meant to:
- Supplement first-year math courses at UTSC
- Introduce students to deeper ideas in pure mathematics
- Build intuition, motivation, and appreciation for abstract reasoning
- Support students’ goals of entering competitive university programs
